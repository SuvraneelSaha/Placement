public class O16_Why_ArrayLists {
    /*
        the first question that comes to the mind is
        why the fuck do we need arraylists

        well when we dont know the specific size of the Array then we use Arraylists

        these  Arraylists are the same as the vectors in C++

        Reason :
        1] in case of Arrays - the size is fixed
        when we dont know what will be the size of the Array
        then we use Arraylists

        2]   Arraylists is a part of the Collections Framework
        it is present in java.util package
